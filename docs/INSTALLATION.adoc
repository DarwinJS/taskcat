The host taskcat is run on requires access to an AWS account, this can be done by any
of the following mechanisms:

1. Environment variables
2. Shared credential file (~/.aws/credentials)
3. AWS config file (~/.aws/config)
4. Assume Role provider
5. Boto2 config file (/etc/boto.cfg and ~/.boto)
6. Instance metadata service on an Amazon EC2 instance that has an IAM role configured.

### Installing via pip3

```python
pip3 install taskcat
```
### Installing via pip3 --user
*will install taskcat into homedir, useful if you get permissions errors with the regular method*

```python
pip3 install taskcat --user
```

???+note
    The user install dir is platform specific

    On Mac:

    - `~/Library/Python/3.x/bin/taskcat`

    On Linux:

    - `~/.local/bin`
 
!!! warning
    Be sure to add the python bin dir to your **$PATH**

### Windows

!!! danger
    Taskcat on Windows is **not supported**.

If you are running Windows 10 we recommend that you install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) and then install taskcat inside the WSL environment using the steps above.
